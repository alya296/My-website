  <h1>Types of Cats</h1>

  <p>Cats are important to have as pets because they offer a unique combination of companionship, independence, and low-maintenance care. Unlike some pets that require constant attention, cats are content spending time alone, making them perfect for busy individuals or those living in smaller spaces. Their presence has been shown to reduce stress and anxiety, providing emotional comfort through their soothing purrs and playful behavior. Cats also require less effort in terms of care compared to dogs, as they groom themselves and donâ€™t need daily walks.
